    <h1>Historical pop culture</h1>

    <h2>A not-very-brief introduction</h2>

    <p>
      My first encounter with historical pop culture was a collection of poems by Robert Service.
      His lyric poems "The Cremation of Sam McGee" and "The Shooting of Dan McGrew" are probably the most well-known today, and both feature dramatic, spooky tales of adventure and death in the Arctic.
      My dad, born and raised in Alaska, used to recite "The Cremation of Sam McGee" to us from memory:
    </p>

    <p>
      There are strange things done 'neath the midnight sun, by the men who moil for gold;
      The Arctic trails have their secret tales which would make your blood run cold.
      The Northern Lights have seen queer sights, but the queerest they ever did see
      Was that night on the marge of Lake LeBarge, I cremated Sam McGee.
    </p>

    <p>
      These poems play out like campfire stories, meant to be read and acted aloud.
      The rhyme scheme and vocabulary are simple; the "ghost story" is the main attraction.
      As a kid enchanted by the very idea of Alaska, "The Cremation of Sam McGee" ranked better than any Arthurian romance or Goosebumps book for high drama and spooky atmosphere.
      Imagine my surprise, then, when I went in search of more supremely somber Robert Service works and found this instead:

      Service wrote for "the masses": most of his poems are irreverent, satirical pictures of life in the Yukon gold-fields, the remote Canadian prairies, and other suitably exotic Northern locales.
      Service himself never actually lived in the remote goldfields; he spent just over a year in Dawson, Alaska, and managed to spin that experience into a decades-long career as the Bard of the Great White North.
      And, like the somewhat more southerly Bard of Stratford-upon-Avon, he catered to the humor of his public.
      His works appeared in popular newspapers and magazines, though most poems made little more lasting impression than any weekly humor column.

      The poems of Robert Service were true items of popular culture: transient articles of amusement, little-remembered today.
      But, like all popular culture, with a bit of legwork, these poems offer a marvelous doorway into another time.
      Once you get to grips with some cultural context, you can step through to find yourself in conversation with a real, often very vibrant and opinionated person from a previous era..
      And, to put it in a very self-centered way, since these works aren't widely discussed today, those conversations often feel enchantingly private, as if you're sharing a fun secret across the ages with some author or artist.
