    <h1>Historical pop culture</h1>

    <p>
      I have a fascination with forgotten articles of popular culture from ages past.
      Say, pre-1920 or so.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a bit of legwork, these works offer a marvelous, highly specific doorway into another time.
      Once you get to grips with some cultural context, you can step through to find yourself in conversation with a real, often very vibrant and opinionated person from a previous era.
      And, to put it in a very self-centered way, since most of these works aren't widely discussed today, those conversations often feel enchantingly private, as if you're sharing a fun secret across the ages with some author or artist.
