    <h1>Banana chips</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Like with many other things, it only occurred to me recently to try making banana chips at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Banana chips have several attractive characteristics as a DIY project:
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to make</li>
        <li>Few variables, so iteration to convergence is straightforward</li>
        <li>Huge differential in outcome quality compared to commercial options</li>
        <li>Turns household waste (brown bananas) into a desirable product</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Grandma Chambers used to make incredible banana chips in her dehydrator.
      It was made of dark gray plastic, and didn't require any electrical components: she would just leave it out in the AZ summer sun for a few hours.
      I have literally never had palatable commercial banana chips, so I always suspected that the commercial process was completely different from this "grandma-style" procedure.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes to self</h2>

    <p>
      Here are my notes to self so far:
      <ul>
        <li>200 degree oven for about 3 hours, depending on thickness</li>
        <li>1/4" is a good starting median thickness. Thinner chips dry faster, but riper bananas may be impossible to slice thinly.</li>
        <li>Sugar caramelizes at about 338 F and burns at around 350 F, so burning isn't a concern. However, chips will wind up with a slightly "charred" flavor if left in the oven too long.
        <li>Browner is better, since increased ripeness increases fruit sugar content, as long as the banana is still structural enough to cut</li>
        <li>4 bananas/wire rack in rounds, 3 bananas/wire rack in a mix of strips and rounds</li>
        <li>It *is* possible to over-dry them. Optimal grandma-style chewy texture requires some moisture to be retained</li>
        <li>Turning the slices over halfway through the bake helps prevent sticking</li>
        <li>Chips will stiffen as they cool, so take them out while they still feel a bit too moist.</li>
        <li>Longitudinal planks will dry faster than rounds, even if they start with the same thickness.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
