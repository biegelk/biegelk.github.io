    <h1>Uniform of a Captain of the 1st Lithuanian Dragoon Regiment, ca. 1830</h1>

    <h2>Overview and Current Status</h2>

    <h2>Selection Parameters</h2>

      <h3>Selecting the date range</h3>
        <p>
          Military uniforms changed slightly more slowly than civilian attire, but the early 19th century was a period of rapid evolution in both spheres.
          Design elements both large and small, both decorative and functional, changed quickly over the years.
          Therefore, choosing as narrow a year range as possible helps to ensure a functional and cohesive set of attire, even if absolute accuracy isn't the goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started with a couple of "end-posts" which limited my time period very nicely.
        <p>

        <ol>
          <li> I wanted to wear a shako instead of a bicorn hat or a Pickelhaube for field or parade order.
          <li> I wanted to wear full trousers/overalls instead of breeches.
          <li> I wanted to avoid the Waffenrock. 
        </ol>

        <h4>The Shako</h4>
        <p>
          Still familiar today as the headwear of choice for many marching bands, the shako is a round, high-crowned, formed-leather hat with a small brim and a chin-strap.
          The shako was widely adopted as a practical improvement over the tricorn and bicorn hats previously used for service dress, and gradually made their way upward in prestige to parade dress as well.
          The shako was eventually supplanted in many contexts and service branches by metal helmets, notably the Pickelhaube (spike-topped helmet) introduced in the Prussian Army beginning in 1847.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to choose a year range which would not require me to wear either a bicorn hat or a Pickelhaube for an officer's service or parade dress.
          The Pickelhaube still has a strong association with militarism and authoritarianism, which I want to avoid.
          Also, as a former marching band kid, the shako is also a bit nostalgic for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          This rather neatly limits my possible range of dates.
          The first shakos entered cavalry service in Prussia in about 1806.
          The Pickelhaube began to become standard in 1847.
          However, we can do much better than a 41-year range.
        </p>

        <h4>Overalls/Trousers</h4>
          <p>
            Knee-length breeches became the standard legwear of choice for men from the lower artisan class through to royalty in the XXth century.
            Breeches buttoned below the knee, and above-the-knee stockings would be worn to cover the calves.
            Men engaged in work where their stockings might get dirty or damaged might wear gaiters over their stockings: protective garments extending from knee to ankle, buttoning up the side.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the latter Napoleonic years, military gaiters evolved into "overalls", which are essentially Ye Olde Snap Pants: a protective outer layer, worn atop breeches and stockings, with functional buttons all the way up the sides.
            In practicality and range of motion they were intended to be similar to a modern mechanic's coveralls.
            Within a decade, the breeches beneath had become totally superfluous, and men began wearing trousers as we would consider them today.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the Prussian army, overalls became standard attire after about 1806.
            However, early overalls were of the aforementioned "Snap Pants" variety, with functional buttons all the way up and down both outseams.
            Over time, these button columns evolved: first, the upper buttons became decorative only, with only buttons below the knee being functional (from about 1813).
            Then, all buttons above the knee were eliminated (from about 1820).
            Finally, visible buttons disappeared, in favor of a small number of buttons hidden under a placket (from about 1836).
          </p>

          <p>
            Sewing buttonholes by hand is extremely time-consuming, and shaping the trousers to fit while still keeping a fully-finished buttonhole-laden edge would be incredibly challenging.
            However, I like the appearance of the visible lower-calf buttons.
            Therefore, we can narrow down our time range to post-1820, with a preference for pre-1836.
          </p>

        <h4>Avoiding the Waffenrock</h4>
          <p>
            The Waffenrock of 1846 bears a considerable resemblance to the dress uniforms of several modern-day U.S. military branches.
            To avoid appearing to imitate e.g. the U.S. Marines dress uniform, it was important to avoid the Waffenrock if possible.
            This consideration gives us a date range end-post of 1845.
          </p>

        <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
          <p>
            These preferences, taken together, give us a date range of 1820-1836.
            Uniforms still evolved over this sort of time scale, but the variation is considerably more manageable.
          </p>

      <h3>Selecting the branch of service</h3>
        <p>
          Between 1820 and 1836, there were four branches of the Prussian cavalry:
          <ol>
            <li>Cuirassiers</li>
            <li>Hussars</li>
            <li>Uhlans/Lancers</li>
            <li>Dragoons</li>
          </ol>
          Uniforms differed significantly among these four groups, so choosing one to focus on was necessary before proceeding.
        </p>

        <h4>Cuirassiers</h4>
          <p>
            A steel cuirass in a historically-accurate shape sized to fit me properly would be an incredibly expensive piece of special-commission artisan work, and putting together a cuirassier uniform without a cuirass seemed like a waste, so I ruled them out.
          </p>

        <h4>Hussars</h4>
          <p>
            I don't have the time, money, or patience to sew $60,000 worth of gold braid to my jacket, and I'm not sure where I could buy a whole leopard pelt to wear as a cape, so hussars were out.
          </p>

        <h4>Uhlans/Lancers</h4>
          <p>
            Uhlans wound up disqualified mostly on aesthetic grounds.
            Their square-topped hats look a little too odd for my preference, and I'm not a fan of the predominant uhlan jacket style.
          </p>
